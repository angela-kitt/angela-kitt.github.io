        <h3>What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is a measure of your ability to understand and be able to regulate your emotions, as well as an understanding of how other people are feeling and knowing how what you do and say will effect others. Part of EQ is being self-aware - knowing your strengths and weaknesses, how you will react to different situations and how you come across to others.</p>
        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>It is different to IQ in that IQ is a measure of academic intelligence - what level is your ability to successfully complete certain analytical tasks and problem solve within a certain time period. Whereas emotional intelligence is an ability to understand social interactions, how to say and do things so that others understand what you meant and look positively on you. While your IQ can be somewhat increased with training, your EQ is something which can be significantly improved with knowledge, experience and practice.</p>
        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is very important in human interactions, and therefore in the workplace. Having a high emotional intelligence will help you make and keep friends, both in life and at work. People will want to talk to you and work with you. You will be more likely to get the job you want and managers will be more likely to give you more opportunities and promotions.</p>
        <p>It is especially important when in leadership positions, many people may have good technical ability in a job but it is those with high emotional intelligence who will be the best leaders.</p>
