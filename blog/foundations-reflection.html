    <h2>Core Blog: Foundations Reflection</h2>

    <h3>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
    </h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>That almost everyone has a judgemental inner voice and we should learn to be kinder to ourselves if we take more time than we would like to figure out a solution to a problem.</li>
          <li>That I can change the way I react to problems by recognising that there will be roadblocks and having a plan for dealing with them ahead of time.</li>
          <li>That my brain is constantly changing and that coding every day will embed the changes that I need and keep the neural connections strong.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    <h3>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    </h3>
      <p>
        They are very important as you need to understand yourself and have empathy for others when interacting with different people who will have different backgrounds and levels of experience. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing your values gives you a solid foundation to work from. Empathy for others, as well as yourself, will improve your effectiveness within a team and your relationships at work and in other parts of your life. Being self-aware of your strengths and weaknesses gives you a better understanding of how you operate and allows you to know what areas you need to work on.
      </p>
    <h3>
      What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </h3>
      <p>
        What I learned about in the growth mindset part of the core learning surprised me most, that letting children know that it is through effort, not inherent intelligence, that academic improvement can be achieved, and this can drastically improve their results. The implications for learning throughout life are also clear and it backs up my own experience of doing better when I work hard at something.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mindfulness part also surprised me, and I also really enjoyed it. I kept up listening to a mindfulness audio session every morning Monday to Friday and sometimes on the weekends too. It helps me relax, so I'm glad it will continue into bootcamp.
      </p>
    <h3>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </h3>
      <p>
        Staying focused on what I was meant to be doing, as many of the concepts were quite intriguing and my brain can fly off thinking in many different directions and get distracted. Also, writing some of the core blogs could be difficult as I'm not used to having to write about myself and my strengths and core values.
      </p>
    <h3>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>
      <p>
        I presume that when talking to people in the industry about what they were looking for when hiring programmers, you heard that programming experience and skills were not the determining factor in whether someone was a good employee and team member. That an ability to work well and relate with others from many different backgrounds was far more important, that web developers with good emotional intelligence were crucial to the success of a team.
      </p>
    <h3>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h3>
      <p>
        Not at all, it has been incredibly useful to me to learn more about many parts of the core learning curriculum. Practising mindfulness has helped me relax and deal with the stress of learning so many new things at once. Putting together a learning plan has helped me develop a routine and commit to sticking with it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowing something about the process of learning means I know if I don't get something, I just have to keep working on it and I will eventually understand it. Practising listening and looping will be useful during bootcamp and in a working environment as it will help with pair programming and teamwork.
