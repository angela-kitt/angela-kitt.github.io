        <h2>Core Blog: Identity and Values</h2> 
        <p>3 July 2022</p>
        <h3>Personal values and ethics</h3>
        <h4>My core values</h4>
        <p>When researching what my core personal values were, I settled on the list below as the main values I try to live by. It's really hard to restrict myself to just a few, as I could choose twenty, but I feel these are the values that most resonate with me.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
          <li>Compassion</li>
          <li>Equality</li>
          <li>Fairness</li>
          <li>Freedom</li>
          <li>Honesty</li>
          <li>Respect</li>
          <li>Tolerance</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Ethics</h4>
        <p>One situation where I had an ethical decision to make was when I accidentally left a large, busy cafe after lunch - while forgetting to pay. I drove at least a kilometre down the road before it popped into my head to wonder if I had paid or not. The values I had to consider in my decision about whether to turn around and pay were honesty and fairness against the inconvenience of returning and the cost of paying.</p>
        <p>I decided to turn around and drive back to the cafe and pay for my meal, as I believe in being honest and that it is only fair to pay for services you have received. The inconvenience of returning would be relatively minor and money wasn't a major problem. In the end, they hadn't even noticed, it was so busy. The consequences were that I felt good about myself for doing the right thing and no server got into trouble.</p>
        <h4>Culture, values and identity</h4>
        <p>The culture I was brought up in influences my belief in personal freedom, as long as you don't infringe on the freedoms of others. It also influences my beliefs in equality and seeking equity in outcomes as much as possible, that we should help each other and look after those who are vulnerable.</p>
        <h3>Strengths and limitations</h3>
        <h4>Strengths</h4>
        <p>My main strengths are my enjoyment of learning new things, my curiosity about the world around me, my open-mindedness, my problem-solving skills and my ability to research and find information about different topics.</p>
        <h4>Limitations</h4>
        <p>My main limitations are frequently getting distracted and procrastinating. I am also reluctant to ask for help and have a tendency to do things the way I want and not consult others.</p>
        <h4>Evaluation</h4>
        <p>I believe my main strength which will help me in my learning journey is my curiosity, which will enable me to research the different skills I will need to complete the course. But I will have to be mindful to not get carried away and go down various rabbit holes and delve too deeply, as it could lead to me being distracted and not having enough time to complete the weekly tasks.</p>
        <h4>Experience</h4>
        <p>One example I can think of where I was trying to work productively with others, but it didn't go as well as I would have liked, was when I was working on a library event for Matariki with a few others. We had different ideas about what the visual display should look like and how much time should have been spent on it.</p>
        <p>At the time, I just went ahead and did the fancy display I wanted, even though it was quite time-consuming. However, I think it would have been best to have a proper meeting with the team responsible for the event and agree on a strategy together and discuss what we wanted the display to look like and how we wanted the event to go. Now, I would make sure everything was discussed beforehand and agreed upon so everyone in the team was happy.</p>
