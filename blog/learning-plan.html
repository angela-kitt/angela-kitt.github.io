        <h2>Core Blog: Learning Plan</h2> 
        <p>2 July 2022</p>
        <h3>My long term career goals</h3>
        <p>I aspire to work in the field of web development or a similar area of IT. I would eventually like to be in a position where I can mainly work from home as part of a team. An area that interests me is virtual reality and how immersive the internet or games may become in the future.</p>
        <h3>My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
        <p>Strengths: I really enjoy learning new things, I am curious about the world around me and how things work - which leads to my curiosity about how computers and computer programs work as they are such a huge part of everyday life. I generally have good problem-solving skills and an ability to research and find reliable information about topics I am interested in.</p>
        <p>Limitations: Self-discipline around keeping up with studying every weekday and not procrastinating or getting distracted. I have a tendency to put things off till the last minute, leading to having to do things in a rush. I can also spend too much time on something I struggle with and instead of asking for help, I try to figure it out myself, which can be a lot more time-consuming then just asking for help.</p>
        <h3>The skills I would like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>The ability to collaborate remotely - I've never worked remotely before, so it is a skill I need to learn, especially being able to work in a team when we are not in the same office.</li>
            <li>The willingness to ask for help early and the knowledge of when I should reach out and when I should try to find out the answer myself.</li>
            <li>Time-keeping is something I need to work on,  because there are a lot of new things to learn, I need to be more disciplined in spending the appropriate amount of time on different tasks.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>My commitment around how I will manage my workload in this programme</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I commit to getting my work done for each sprint by the end of the week, doing some coding every day and being on time for our weekly team catch up (or letting a facilitator know if I can't make it for some reason).</li>
            <li>I will try to always be mindful of others feelings in both verbal and written communications.</li>
            <li>If things start building up or I feel overwhelmed I will reach out to my fellow students or a facilitator for help and advice.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>My commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        <p>If I get stuck on something and can't figure it out in the suggested time, I will ask for help in the appropriate channel on Discord. If I am struggling with the workload or I get sick, I will contact a facilitator through Discord straight away for advice and support.</p>
        <h3>What do I expect from the Facilitation team?</h3>
        <p>I expect if I need help with anything, I can reach out to them and will hear back within a reasonable amount of time. I expect to get feedback on my submitted work and suggestions for improvement if I am lacking in a particular area.</p>
