        <h2>Learning Plan Reflection</h2> 
          <p>19 September 2022</p>
          <p>
            My long term goals remain the same, I have really enjoyed my learning journey with Dev Academy and have learned so much over these last few months. I'm really pleased I choose to study Web Development as I really enjoy it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have worked hard during my time at Dev Academy and I am proud that I have kept up with the goal of studying 60 hours a week, while also taking time to rest and refresh myself at lunch-time and one day on the weekend. I have built up some good habits - of practising mindfullness in the morning and going for walks at lunch-time which I hope I can keep up when I graduate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The areas I have found the most difficult are pair-programming and group projects, some pairs are very easy and some require a lot more effort if we have very different communication styles. But working closely with so many different types of people has been very valuable and I've learned many valuable human skills like active-listening and checking in with how my pair is feeling. Group projects can be challenging as we are all beginners and sometimes don't understand how to do things, which can make progress slow, but the last two projects have been more relaxed and fun as we have learned to stress less about the final product and concentrate more on team-building.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I think I have followed my learning plan very closely, which I'm very pleased with and have found putting together a self-learning plan a valuable tool for helping me learn.
          </p>
        <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2> 
          <p>24 July 2022</p>
        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm hoping to get a job as a junior web developer or something closely related so I can keep the skills I will learn fresh. I hope to be able to contribute to the New Zealand tech sector and work for a New Zealand-based company, but I don't have a specific company in mind. I would love to one day work in the virtual or augmented reality field.
          </p>
        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
          <p>
            I think my strengths and limitations are broadly the same. I think I have learned extra problem-solving tools which will help me during bootcamp and I think the nature of bootcamp will help lessen my limitations - getting distracted, procrastinating, being reluctant to ask for help - as I will be working less on my own so it's harder to be distracted and easier to ask for help in a zoom call.
          </p>
        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
          <p>
            I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be pair-programming and working in groups as it's not something I have any experience with in a programming context. When I have no experience with something, it makes me nervous, hopefully with practise and getting to know the different people in my cohort better it will get easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another challenge I think I will have is maintaining the workload of 50-60 hours a week for nine weeks in a row, I will have to be disciplined about finding time to rest and relax when I can.
          </p>
        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
          <p>
            I would definitely like to develop my teamwork and pairing skills, especially in an online environment as I have no experience with working with others online. Being new to programming, I also have no experience with teamwork and pairing in a programming environment, so they will be my areas of focus during bootcamp.
          </p>
        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
          <p>
            My expectations are that if I have any non-technical problems crop up, I can talk to the human skills facilitators for advice about how to go about solving the problem, as they will be experienced in helping students in those areas. I also expect that if I need technical advice or help I can message or chat with a technical facilitator and that if there are any mistakes or issues with my work they will let me know so I can improve.
          </p>
        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself in Bootcamp?</h3>
          <p>
            I will ask for help if I need it - if I'm working in a pair or group at the time, I will ask others there for help. If the problem isn't resolved, I will then seek help or clarification from others in the cohort or one of the facilitators.
          </p>
          <p>
            My commitment for how I will manage my workload during bootcamp is I will try to stay focused in normal bootcamp hours so I don't have to spend hours every night keeping up with the workload and I will carve out one day on the weekend when I will mainly relax. The other day can be for any projects I need to work on. I will communicate with others on the course in a considerate manner and do my best to be a good team member.
          </p>
        <h2>Core Blog: Learning Plan</h2> 
          <p>2 July 2022</p>
        <h3>My long term career goals</h3>
          <p>
            I aspire to work in the field of web development or a similar area of IT. I would eventually like to be in a position where I can mainly work from home as part of a team. An area that interests me is virtual reality and how immersive the internet or games may become in the future.
          </p>
        <h3>My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
          <p>
            Strengths: I really enjoy learning new things, I am curious about the world around me and how things work - which leads to my curiosity about how computers and computer programs work as they are such a huge part of everyday life. I generally have good problem-solving skills and an ability to research and find reliable information about topics I am interested in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Limitations: Self-discipline around keeping up with studying every weekday and not procrastinating or getting distracted. I have a tendency to put things off till the last minute, leading to having to do things in a rush. I can also spend too much time on something I struggle with and instead of asking for help, I try to figure it out myself, which can be a lot more time-consuming then just asking for help.
        </p>
        <h3>The skills I would like to see developed in myself while at Dev Academy</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>The ability to collaborate remotely - I've never worked remotely before, so it is a skill I need to learn, especially being able to work in a team when we are not in the same office.</li>
              <li>The willingness to ask for help early and the knowledge of when I should reach out and when I should try to find out the answer myself.</li>
              <li>Time-keeping is something I need to work on,  because there are a lot of new things to learn, I need to be more disciplined in spending the appropriate amount of time on different tasks.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        <h3>My commitment around how I will manage my workload in this programme</h3>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>I commit to getting my work done for each sprint by the end of the week, doing some coding every day and being on time for our weekly team catch up (or letting a facilitator know if I can't make it for some reason).</li>
              <li>I will try to always be mindful of others feelings in both verbal and written communications.</li>
              <li>If things start building up or I feel overwhelmed I will reach out to my fellow students or a facilitator for help and advice.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        <h3>My commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
          <p>
            If I get stuck on something and can't figure it out in the suggested time, I will ask for help in the appropriate channel on Discord. If I am struggling with the workload or I get sick, I will contact a facilitator through Discord straight away for advice and support.
          </p>
        <h3>What do I expect from the Facilitation team?</h3>
          <p>
            I expect if I need help with anything, I can reach out to them and will hear back within a reasonable amount of time. I expect to get feedback on my submitted work and suggestions for improvement if I am lacking in a particular area.
