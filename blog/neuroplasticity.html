    <h3>
      Neuroplasticity
    </h3>
    <p>
      Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity helps increase motivation and learning performance. The knowledge that the brain can change, that you can gain skills and increase performance just by thinking about doing a task, helps motivate people to keep trying at something they may have initially found hard. The knowledge that if you don't keep practising, you can lose skills you already had - such as forgetting a second language - helps motivate people to keep using their skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit by being aware that practising something, such as programming, every day - hardwires the brain to make the process easier over time. Being aware that it is the process of doing and firing my neurons in certain patterns that will increase my skill level and problem-solving ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ways to increase your neuroplasticity are practising a task repeatedly, thinking about how you did on a task and writing down your thoughts and reflections about how you felt about the task and how well it went. Being consistent and building a habit of performing the task every day.

    <h3>
      Growth Mindset
    </h3>
    <p>
      A growth mindset is a belief that qualities such as intelligence, creativity and personality are rarely inherent traits but based on effort, practise and a positive mindset that knows it can improve or change with time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was surprised at how quickly understanding the concept can affect the academic performance of children. It makes sense though, if children learn that their academic ability isn't fixed from birth, that they can improve with effort - they will persevere instead of giving up early or avoiding subjects they find challenging.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also intriguing to consider that there may be aspects of what I perceive to be my personality - such as shyness, that I could change with effort. That is something I will work on and research in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey by keeping in mind that I can learn anything if I put in the time and effort and keep a positive outlook. Being aware that I can and will get better with practice and repetition will help give me the confidence to keep trying.

    <h3>
      Blend with your learning plan and strategies
    </h3>
    <p>
      While I was always aware that you only got better with practice, understanding that ability is not innate and something that can be improved over time and that learning new skills changes the structure of the brain is very encouraging. It will certainly influence how I approach learning, now and in the future. Learning isn't something you do once, it's a process over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will incorporate these understandings into my learning strategy by practising programming every day and not being discouraged if I don't initially achieve what I want. Learning programming isn't about getting an answer right and moving on, it's about practising your problem-solving skills and stretching your mental muscles every day.
