    <h2>Technical Blog: Problem Solving</h2>

      Problem solving is an essential skill you need to cultivate if you are to become a Web Developer. You first need to make sure you understand the problem, learn how to break a problem down into easy-to-manage parts and how to put those parts back together to solve the whole problem.

    <h3>A time I was blocked on a simple problem</h3>
    <p>
      I was having major problems figuring out the last question in the functions (with parameters) quiz during the JavaScript Intro on Open Class. We had to write a function named 'warn' that takes a string parameter and returns the string twice with a space between.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem-solving techniques I used were: trying something, reading error messages, console.logging, googling and finally asking peers for help. Afterwards I reflected on why I didn't understand the initial problem and why it took me so long to simply ask for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt frustrated because I couldn't understand why it wasn't working. I saw from the test that the parameter the test was using was 'Awoogah!', so I mistakenly thought I needed to include 'Awoogah!' in the code. This meant even when I had the basic structure of the code right, the test always failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learnt that you need to first understand exactly what is expected, that the tests are just there to validate that the code does what is intended. That you shouldn't include the output from the tests, like 'Awoogah!' in the code itself. Realising that simple fact, after asking for help, really made things click.

    <h3>A time I elegantly solved a problem</h3>
    <p>
      I don't know if it could be described as elegant, but I solved the Super FizzBuzz problem in the JavaScript Kata on Repl.it much quicker than I thought I would. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We had to write a function that took a number and if the number was divisible by 3 return 'Fizz', if it was divisible by 5 return 'Buzz', and if it was divisible by both return 'FizzBuzz'. We then needed to write another function, that took multiple numbers in an array and did the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem-solving techniques I used were pseudocode, trying something, reading error messages and googling. I solved this problem quite quickly, so I didn't need to use too many techniques here.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt satisfied that I understood what I was being asked to do and already had an idea of what the basic structure would be, before I started writing the code. Each time I passed another test, I felt a sense of accomplishment and when I got the final 'You did it!' I was really pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      I learnt that paying attention to exactly what is being asked, breaking down a larger problem into smaller chunks and following a logical, step-by-step process is a good way to solve coding problems. I learnt that pseudocode is especially useful, not only in planning your code at the beginning but also for explaining what your thinking was at different steps to others and yourself in the future.

    <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode: I feel confident using pseudocode, I have started using it more frequently as I find it very useful.</li>
        <li>Trying something: I have always found it doesn't hurt to just try different things, you may get lucky.</li>
        <li>Rubber ducky method: I haven't used this technique yet, as I would feel self-conscious talking aloud to myself. If I did, it would be under my breath as I don't like disturbing others.</li>
        <li>Reading error messages: I have used this technique and while it confused me at first, I now feel confident I can understand the messages.</li>
        <li>Console.logging: this is definitely useful and I have used it frequently, so I feel confident with this technique.</li>
        <li>Googling: I feel like my googling skills are getting better, but I think I still need lots of practice - so semi-confident.</li>
        <li>Asking your peers for help: at first I was a bit reluctant, but it's much easier now, so I feel happy asking peers for help.</li>
        <li>Asking coaches for help: I feel confident I could ask coaches for help,  though I haven't had to do it yet.</li>
        <li>Improving your process with reflection: I feel confident about this one, as I can see how useful it is and have used it multiple times.</li>
      </ul>
